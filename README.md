# ȱ prototype

## The Project 

ȱ is a chat system under design. It:

  - is open source
  - performs end-to-end encryption
  - serverless design
  - transmission of messages over peers in a mesh network
  - allows group chats of unlimited size
  - has eventually consistent history

See [DESIGN.txt](DESIGN.txt) for more information.


## This repository

This repository is used for prototyping parts of ȱ.
It contains quickly moving Lua code with no API guarantees.
